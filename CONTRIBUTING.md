## üöÄ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Docker 20.10+
- Git
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Local Development

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flask-container-vm.git
   cd flask-container-vm
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # If available
   ```

4. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   pytest test_app.py -v
   ```

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for all functions and classes
- Keep line length under 88 characters (Black formatter standard)

### Docker Best Practices

- Use multi-stage builds for optimization
- Minimize image layers
- Use specific version tags
- Run as non-root user
- Include health checks

### Documentation

- Update README.md for significant changes
- Add docstrings to new functions
- Update API documentation if endpoints change
- Include examples in docstrings

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new features
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Aim for high test coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest test_app.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v
```

### Test Structure

```python
def test_function_name_should_do_something():
    # Arrange
    input_data = "test"
    
    # Act
    result = function_under_test(input_data)
    
    # Assert
    assert result == expected_output
```
