## Section 1: CI/CD Pipeline with Docker

### 1.1 Application Architecture

The Flask application implements a comprehensive benchmarking suite with the following components:

**Core Features:**
- RESTful API endpoints for performance testing
- CPU-intensive computation tasks
- Memory stress testing capabilities
- Parallel processing demonstrations
- Health monitoring and metrics collection

### 1.2 Production-Grade Dockerfile

```dockerfile
# Use official Python image as base
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Install system dependencies
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    gcc \
    curl \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy requirements first for better caching
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install Python dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Create non-root user for security
RUN useradd --create-home --shell /bin/bash app && \
    chown -R app:app /app
USER app

# Expose port
EXPOSE 5000

# Health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
    CMD curl -f http://localhost:5000/health || exit 1

# Define entry point
CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:5000", "--workers", "4", "--timeout", "120", "app:app"]
```

**Security Best Practices:**
- Non-root user execution
- Minimal base image (slim variant)
- Health check implementation
- Dependency scanning ready
